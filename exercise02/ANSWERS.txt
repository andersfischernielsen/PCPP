No, the addAndGet()-method would not give the expected result, since the increment (+=) operator is not a single atomic operation.
We got varying result using a non-synchronized addAndGet call with a volatile private int value, demonstrating that the AtomicInteger isn't atomic.

There is a noticeable difference. The built-in class is faster.

I would say that making the field static would be a good idea, since that ensures that other threads don't see the AtomicInteger in a partially constructed state.
